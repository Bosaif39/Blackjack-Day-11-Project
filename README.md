This is the day 11 project of the course 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.

### How It Works Blackjack Rules 

1. **Objective**:
   - Get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
   - Beat the dealer's hand.

2. **Card Values**:
   - Number cards (2-10): Worth their face value.
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): Worth 10 points.
   - Aces: Worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is better.

3. **Dealing**:
   - Each player and the dealer get two cards.
   - Players' cards are face-up; one of the dealer's cards is face-down.

4. **Player's Actions**:
   - Draw another card.
   - Keep your current hand.
  
5. **Dealer's Actions**:
   - The dealer must draw cards until they have at least 17 points.

6. **Winning**:
   - **Blackjack**: An Ace and a 10-point card.
   - **Win**: Your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over.
   - **Draw**: Tie with the dealer.
   - **Loss**: Your hand goes over 21 or is lower than the dealerâ€™s hand.
