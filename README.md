# **Blackjack**

## **Overview:**

This is the Day 11 project from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. This script simulates a game of Blackjack where players aim to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, and beat the dealer's hand.

##  How It Works:

### **Blackjack Rules:**

1. **Objective:**
   - Get as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it.
   - Beat the dealer's hand.

2. **Card Values:**
   - Number cards (2-10): Worth their face value.
   - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King): Worth 10 points.
   - Aces: Worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value is more advantageous.

3. **Dealing:**
   - Both the player and the dealer receive two cards.
   - The player's cards are face-up, while one of the dealer's cards is face-down.

4. **Player's Actions:**
   - Draw another card or keep their current hand.

5. **Dealer's Actions:**
   - The dealer must draw cards until their hand reaches at least 17 points.

6. **Winning:**
   - **Blackjack:** An Ace and a 10-point card.
   - **Win:** Your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding 21.
   - **Draw:** Your hand ties with the dealer’s hand.
   - **Loss:** Your hand exceeds 21 or is less than the dealer’s hand.
